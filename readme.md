Code for Computacional Biology labs course in Tecnico Lisboa in 2014

This is fully run in client side, using angularjs, so don't run this on slow machines, don't tell me that I didn't warn you.

The lab code is inside the app/ folder, views are in the app/views/bc/ and the javascript is inside the app/scripts/controllers/ folder.
Files are named with the number of the lab.

    
To run this you need nodejs, bower and grunt installed and run:
  
    npm install
    grunt serve


A live version is available in http://diutsu.net/bc-labs/ ( I can't  promise
that it will be running forever)
